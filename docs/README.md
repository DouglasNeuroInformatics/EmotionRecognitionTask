# DNP jsPsych Template

This is a template for the DNP's jsPsych tasks.
It is designed to be a resource for developers at the DNP or elsewhere to create tasks using jsPsych.
A goal of this template is to have tasks serve as instruments for the [OpenDataCapture](https://opendatacapture.org/en/) (ODC) project developed at the DNP.
These docs assume some Typescript experience.
